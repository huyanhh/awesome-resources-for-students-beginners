# Awesome Stuff for Students and Beginners

> A collection of useful resources for students in tech to break out of the traditional school paradigm

Inspired by the [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) list, [This Week in Swift](https://swiftnews.curated.co/), and the [Ruby Rogues Podcast Picks](https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues)

Meant to accompany my blog here: https://medium.com/learn-designing-hacking-life

I do reuse some resources found in other "awesome" repositories, but these will be repurposed for university students, following a structure of how I learned the content and what I'm using currently. So links will sorted by months in chronological order as if the list were a mini-curriculum. See CONTRIBUTING.md if you want to help add links for future blog posts!
